The United States has always made the border seem like the a defense that is used to keep out illegal immigrants.

Recently though the border seems to have lost its purpose as it was once a line of security that was meant to stopping illegal immigration to now becoming determine one's immigration status.

What exactly was the border's main purpose for the United States?

It was once known to he the last line of defense for America's people, culture, and economy but has seem to be a way to create fear of Americans that will lead to more support about the border.
