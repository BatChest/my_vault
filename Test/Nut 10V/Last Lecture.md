### Three key Rationales of the DGA
1. Maintain a healthy weight
2. Promotion of overall health

3. Soda/Energy drinks
4. Yeast breads
5. Chicken & mixed chicken dishes

###### Adults(ages 19+)

### Three Key Terms of the DGA
1. Eating patterns:
The combination of foods and beverages that constitute an individaul's complete dietary intake.

Dietary intakes compared to recommendations. Percent of the U.S. population of ages 1 year and older who are below, at, or above each dietary goal or limit

This chart shows us that the eating pattern of Americans needs some improvement as they are not getting the recommended amount for fruits and vegetables while they over the limit of sodium, added sugars, and saturated fat.

2. Nutrient Dense:
Focus on foods that have the largest amount of nutrients relative to the number of calories per serving.
Examples of nutrient dense foods:

```

Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium

```

#### Foods and Food Components To Reduce
###### Reduce intake of calorie from solid fats & added sugars
- Added sugar recommendation:
limit to less than 10% of total calories

- Daily value: < 50g/day for 2000 calorie diet

Where are the sources of these added sugars.

- Adults (18-64 yrs.) 150 minutes. moderate physical activity weekly (30 min./day), additional health benefits with 300 minutes weekly
