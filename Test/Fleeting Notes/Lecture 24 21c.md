What are candidates of extreme values?
(x$_0$, y$_0$)

### Geometric way of locating the extreme values
Critical Points are enclosed by shrinking loops
local max = if evaluation gets bigger as the loops shrink
local min =  if evaluation gets smaller as the loops shrink

### Saddle Point
Geometric: A point at which level the level curves self-intersect is called a saddle point
Along some directions it is the maximum but along other directions it is the minimum

Some local quadratic pictures to keep in mind:

Suppose we have $f$(x$_0$, y$_0$) = 0. Suppose all derivatives of $f$ are continuous at (x$_0$, y$_0$) .

What will happen if D > 0?
