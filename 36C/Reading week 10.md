### Terrorist on the Border: The Minutemen Stalk Their Prey

- The Klu Klux Klan is the most prominant nativist group
- Consists of farmers and lower-classed workers
- Nativist movements are often drawn from the downwardly mobile-class and white-collar workers, but find boosters among the representatives of the elite
- Border Patrol Rejects, Chris Simcox: "We are showing the government the model for home-land security".
- The Minute-man Project's aim is to create "citizens' patrols" on the border and compel the government to take stricter measures to curb undocumented immigration.


- The use of the tragedy of Septemeber 11th was able to be used as way for right-wing forces to gain back power to make the American people afraid again 
- Use this fear of immigrants to move their agenda of ant-immigration and covered it as a "War on Terroism"
